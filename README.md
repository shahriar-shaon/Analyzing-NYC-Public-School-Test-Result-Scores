Every year, high school students in the United States take the SATs, which are standardized tests designed to assess literacy, numeracy, and writing abilities. There are three sections, each with a maximum score of 800 points: reading, math, and writing. These exams are critical for both students and colleges because they play an important role in the admissions process.

School performance analysis is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, the government, and even parents who are deciding which school their children should attend.

we will examine SAT data from public schools in New York City.
